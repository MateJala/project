                    <li>Every year, we lose around 10 million hectares of forest—an area roughly the size of Iceland. Forests are crucial for clean air, wildlife, and combating climate change.</li>
                    <li>Over 8 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year, harming marine life and polluting our waters.</li>
                    <li>One tree can absorb about 48 pounds of carbon dioxide per year, helping to reduce the effects of climate change.</li>
                    <li>Coral reefs cover less than 0.1% of the ocean’s surface but support 25% of marine life, making them vital to ocean health.</li>
                    <li>The Earth's temperature has increased by approximately 1.2°C since the late 1800s, with major consequences for ecosystems and weather patterns.</li>
